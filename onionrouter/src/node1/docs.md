# Mutex 
A mutex is a synchronization mechanism that allows exclusive access to a shared resource to only one thread (or process) at a time.  It is used to prevent data races (race conditions) and other problems that arise with competitive access to data.

**Detailed explanation:**

Imagine that you have a common variable that is used by multiple threads. If two threads try to change this variable at the same time, the result may be unpredictable and most likely incorrect.  The mutex helps to avoid this problem.

**Basic mutex operations:**

1. **Lock:**
* The thread is trying to capture the mutex.
    * If the mutex is free (not captured by another thread), then the thread captures it and continues execution.  Now this thread is the "owner" of the mutex.
    * If the mutex has already been captured by another thread, the current thread is blocked (goes into standby state) until the mutex is released.

2. **Unlock:**
* The thread that owns the mutex releases it.
    * The mutex becomes available for capture by other threads.
    * One of the threads waiting to capture the mutex will be unblocked and capture the mutex.  (The order in which threads are unblocked may depend on the implementation of the mutex and the operating system).

**Key characteristics of mutexes:**

* **Exclusive access:** Only one thread can own a mutex at any given time.
* **Blocking:** Threads trying to capture an occupied mutex are blocked.
* **Ownership:** A mutex has an owner, the thread that captured it.
* **Release by the owner:** Only the owner of the mutex can release it.  An attempt to release the mutex by another thread will result in an error (in most implementations).
* **Purpose:** Protection of shared resources (memory, files, devices, etc.).

**Usage example (pseudocode):**

```
// Mutex declaration
Mutex myMutex;

// Stream 1
function thread1() {
myMutex.lock(); // Mutex capture

  // Critical section: access to a shared resource
  sharedResource = sharedResource + 1;
  print(sharedResource);

  myMutex.unlock(); // Releasing the mutex
}

// Stream 2
function thread2() {
  myMutex.lock(); // Mutex capture

  // Critical section: access to a shared resource
  sharedResource = sharedResource * 2;
  print(sharedResource);

  myMutex.unlock(); // Releasing the mutex
}
```

In this example, both threads are trying to access the shared variable `sharedResource'. The mutex ensures that only one thread can be in the critical section at any given time (between `lock()` and `unlock()`) and change this variable.

**Mutexes vs Semaphores:**

* **Mutex:** Binary semaphore.  Designed to protect a *shared resource*.  It can only be released by the thread that captured it.  It is usually used to control access to data.
* **Semaphore:** A more general synchronization mechanism.  Can control access to *a limited number of resources*. May be released by another thread (in some implementations). It is used to control access to connection pools, buffers, etc.

**Mutexes vs Critical Sections:**

* **Mutex:** Works between *processes*.  Heavier than the critical section.
* **Critical Section:** Works only inside *one process*.  It is lighter and faster than a mutex, but cannot be used for synchronization between processes.

**Problems related to mutexes:**

* **Deadlock (mutual blocking):** When two or more threads are blocked waiting for each other, forming a loop.  For example, thread 1 has captured mutex A and is waiting for mutex B, and thread 2 has captured mutex B and is waiting for mutex A.
* **Priority Inversion:** A high-priority thread is waiting for a mutex captured by a low-priority thread.  This can cause the high-priority thread to be idle until the low-priority thread releases the mutex.
* **Starvation (starvation):** A thread is constantly unable to access the mutex because other threads are constantly grabbing it.

**Implementation of mutexes:**

Mutexes are implemented using low-level synchronization primitives provided by the operating system (for example, atomic operations, semaphores).

**In conclusion:**

A mutex is an important tool for ensuring thread safety and preventing data races in multithreaded applications. Proper use of mutexes requires an understanding of their operation and potential problems (deadlock, priority inversion, starvation). It is important to carefully design the synchronization system to avoid these problems and ensure the effective operation of the application.
