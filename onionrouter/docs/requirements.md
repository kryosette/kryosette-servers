### **Requirements for an anonymous network**  

#### **1. Security and resistance to attacks**  
- The system must provide ** reasonable resistance to attacks** (see section 3).
- Protection must be achieved with **minimal overhead**.  
- Users **should not run synchronized protocols** to ensure anonymity.  

#### **2. Decentralization and trust**  
- The system should be **decentralized** and not depend on a single trusted service.  
- Users should be able to **select the components (nodes) they trust**.  
- There must be a guarantee that users ** are actually using the selected components** (node verification).  

#### **3. Cryptographic reliability**  
- The system must use ** well-studied and generally accepted cryptographic protocols**.  
- Anonymity ** should not be reduced due to protocol vulnerabilities**.  

#### **4. Equity in resource allocation**  
- The system must be **resistant to abuse**:  
  - No user should be able to **block others** by generating a large volume of traffic.  

#### **5. Modularity and flexibility**  
- The architecture of the system should be modular in order to:
- Quickly add and test new components.  
  - Provide easy ** adaptation to changes**.  

#### **6. Fault tolerance and stability**  
- If one component fails **, only the connections of users using this component** should be terminated.  
- New or restarted components should be **easily integrated** into the system.
